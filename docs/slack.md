# Slack Bot Setup Guide

Step-by-step guide to create and configure a Slack bot for openab.

## 1. Create a Slack App

1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Click **Create New App** → **From scratch**
3. Enter an app name (e.g. "OpenAB") and select your workspace
4. Click **Create App**

## 2. Enable Socket Mode

Socket Mode uses a persistent WebSocket connection — no public URL or ingress needed.

1. In the left sidebar, click **Socket Mode**
2. Toggle **Enable Socket Mode** to ON
3. You'll be prompted to generate an **App-Level Token**:
   - Token name: `openab-socket` (or any name)
   - Scope: `connections:write`
   - Click **Generate**
4. Copy the token (`xapp-...`) — this is your `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`

## 3. Subscribe to Events

1. In the left sidebar, click **Event Subscriptions**
2. Toggle **Enable Events** to ON
3. Under **Subscribe to bot events**, add:
   - `app_mention` — triggers when someone @mentions the bot
   - `message.channels` — receives messages in public channels (for thread follow-ups)
   - `message.groups` — receives messages in private channels (for thread follow-ups)
4. Click **Save Changes**

## 4. Add Bot Token Scopes

1. In the left sidebar, click **OAuth & Permissions**
2. Under **Bot Token Scopes**, add:

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `app_mentions:read` | Receive @mention events |
| `chat:write` | Send and edit messages |
| `channels:history` | Read public channel messages (for thread context) |
| `groups:history` | Read private channel messages (for thread context) |
| `channels:read` | List public channels |
| `groups:read` | List private channels |
| `reactions:write` | Add/remove emoji reactions |
| `files:read` | Download file attachments (images, audio) |
| `users:read` | Resolve user display names |
| `assistant:write` | Native streaming + assistant status line (required when `assistant_mode = true`) |

## 5. Install to Workspace

1. In the left sidebar, click **Install App**
2. Click **Install to Workspace** (or **Reinstall** if you've changed scopes)
3. Authorize the requested permissions
4. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-...`) — this is your `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`

## 6. Configure openab

> 📖 Full config options with defaults: [docs/config-reference.md](config-reference.md#slack)

Add the `[slack]` section to your `config.toml`:

```toml
[slack]
bot_token = "${SLACK_BOT_TOKEN}"
app_token = "${SLACK_APP_TOKEN}"
allowed_channels = []                # empty = allow all channels
# allowed_users = ["U0123456789"]    # empty = allow all users
```

### Normal-channel inline replies and handoff

By default, normal-channel `@OpenAB` mentions reply in a Slack thread rooted at
the triggering message. Set inline mode when you want the bot to answer as a
top-level channel message instead:

```toml
[slack]
normal_channel_reply_mode = "inline"
```

When `[context_mcp] handoff_enabled = true` and the OpenAB MCP server is
injected into the agent, inline normal-channel turns include a short-lived
`handoff_token` in `<sender_context>`. The agent can call `handoff_to_thread`
with that token, a title, and a task prompt to route the supplied prompt to a
new Slack thread rooted at the original user message timestamp. The parent
inline reply should only acknowledge the created thread.

Set the environment variables:

```bash
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-..."
export SLACK_APP_TOKEN="xapp-..."
```

### Assistant Mode (default: enabled)

`assistant_mode` is **enabled by default**. This uses Slack's native AI-app APIs for streaming (`chat.startStream`/`appendStream`/`stopStream`) and status indicators (`assistant.threads.setStatus`) instead of the legacy post+edit loop and emoji reactions.

**Requirements:** Your Slack app must be an [AI app](https://api.slack.com/docs/apps/ai) with the `assistant:write` scope. If your app already has `chat:write`, you only need to add `assistant:write` and reinstall.

**Non-AI app compatibility:** If your Slack app is **not** an AI app (or lacks `assistant:write`), set:

```toml
[slack]
assistant_mode = false
```

This keeps the previous behavior: post+edit streaming with emoji reactions (👀 / ✅ / ❌) for status indicators. Without this opt-out, message delivery still works (native streaming degrades to post+edit automatically), but thinking/tool-use indicators will not be visible.

## 7. Invite the Bot

In each Slack channel where you want to use the bot:

```
/invite @OpenAB
```

## 8. Test

In a channel where the bot is invited:

```
@OpenAB explain this code
```

The bot will reply in a thread. After that, just type in the thread — no @mention needed for follow-ups.

## Native slash commands are not supported on Slack

openab supports `/models`, `/agents`, and full slash command registration on **Discord**, but **not on Slack**. If you previously configured these commands in your Slack app's **Slash Commands** page, you can safely delete them — the Slack adapter ignores both `slash_commands` and `interactive` envelope types.

Slack does support one text command inside openab threads: send `/cancel` as a normal message in the thread to cancel the current in-flight turn.

The root cause is a combination of three Slack-specific platform constraints, none of which is fixable from openab's side:

1. **Slack blocks third-party slash commands inside threads.** Invoking `/models` from a thread's reply composer returns the Slack error `"/models is not supported in threads. Sorry!"`. This is enforced by the Slack client itself, not by any app setting — enabling Interactivity, Socket Mode, or reinstalling the app does not bypass it. Slack's built-in commands (`/remind`, `/shrug`, etc.) get special treatment that custom apps cannot.

2. **Channel-level slash command payloads have no thread context.** If the user types `/models` in the channel's main composer instead of a thread, Slack delivers the command but the payload carries no `thread_ts`. Since openab keys each ACP session by thread (`slack:<thread_ts>` or `slack:<trigger_ts>`), the command cannot be routed to the right session. Sessions are never keyed by `channel_id` alone, so there's no workaround on the adapter side.

3. **Most ACP agents don't expose a model-switch surface.** Even when routing succeeded, `/models` reads the session's `configOptions` from the ACP `initialize` response. Only `kiro-cli` emits these in the expected format (via its `models`/`modes` fallback). `claude-code`, `codex`, `gemini`, `cursor-agent`, and `opencode` do not, so the menu would be empty for those backends — the user would see `"⚠️ No model options available"` with no recourse.

On Discord, none of these apply: slash commands work in thread-channels, the channel ID *is* the thread key, and users typically stay within a single agent per deployment anyway.

### If you need to switch models or agents with a Slack deployment

- **Change the agent**: edit `[agent]` in `config.toml` (or the Helm chart values) and restart the pod / process
- **Change the Claude model** (for `claude-code`): set `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_MODEL` (or equivalent env var depending on your claude-code-acp version) and restart — model selection happens at process start, not at runtime
- **Cancel an in-flight turn**: send `/cancel` as a normal message in the openab Slack thread.

## Finding Channel and User IDs

- **Channel ID**: Right-click the channel name → **View channel details** → ID at the bottom (starts with `C` for public, `G` for private)
- **User ID**: Click a user's profile → **...** menu → **Copy member ID** (starts with `U`)

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't respond to @mentions

1. Verify Socket Mode is enabled in your app settings
2. Check that `app_mention` is subscribed under **bot events** (not user events)
3. Ensure the app is reinstalled after adding new event subscriptions
4. Check the bot is invited to the channel (`/invite @YourSlackAppName`)
5. Run with `RUST_LOG=openab=debug cargo run` to see incoming events

### Bot doesn't respond to thread follow-ups

1. Verify `message.channels` (and `message.groups` for private channels) are subscribed under **bot events**
2. Reinstall the app after adding these events

### "not_authed" or "invalid_auth" errors

1. Verify your `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` starts with `xoxb-`
2. Verify your `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` starts with `xapp-`
3. Check the tokens haven't been revoked in your app settings

### Reactions not showing

1. Verify `reactions:write` scope is added
2. Reinstall the app after adding the scope
3. If `assistant_mode = true` (the default), emoji reactions are intentionally suppressed — status is shown via the assistant status line instead. Set `assistant_mode = false` if you want emoji reactions back.

### Assistant status line not showing ("Thinking…" / "Using tool…")

1. Verify your Slack app is configured as an [AI app](https://api.slack.com/docs/apps/ai)
2. Verify `assistant:write` scope is added under **Bot Token Scopes**
3. Reinstall the app after adding the scope
4. If your app cannot be an AI app, set `assistant_mode = false` to use emoji reactions instead

### Native streaming not working (replies appear all at once)

1. `chat.startStream` requires the `assistant:write` scope — the adapter automatically degrades to post+edit if the API call fails
2. Native streaming is also suppressed when another bot is present in the thread (to avoid edit interference)
3. Check logs for `warn` messages about `stream_begin` failures
