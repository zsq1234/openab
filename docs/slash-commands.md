# Slash Commands

OpenAB registers Discord slash commands for session control. These work in both guild threads and DMs.

## Commands

| Command | Description | Requires active session? |
|---------|-------------|--------------------------|
| `/models` | Select the AI model via dropdown menu | Yes |
| `/agents` | Select the agent mode via dropdown menu | Yes |
| `/cancel` | Cancel the current in-flight operation | Yes |
| `/reset` | Reset the conversation session (clear history, start fresh) | Yes |
| `/remind` | Set a one-shot delayed reminder to mention users/roles | No |
| `/export-thread` | Export thread/DM as `.txt` (default: last 100 messages) | No |

All responses are **ephemeral** — only the user who invoked the command sees the reply.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Supported | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Discord (guild threads) | ✅ | Commands registered per-guild for instant availability |
| Discord (DMs) | ✅ | Commands registered globally; may take up to 1 hour to appear after first deploy |
| Slack | ❌ | Native Slack slash commands are not supported in threads. Send `/cancel` as a normal thread message to cancel an in-flight turn; see [slack.md](slack.md#native-slash-commands-are-not-supported-on-slack) |

## How They Work

### `/models` and `/agents`

These read `configOptions` from the ACP `initialize` / `session/new` response and present them as a Discord Select Menu.

When the user picks an option, OpenAB sends `session/set_config_option` to the ACP backend.

**Agent support varies:**

| Agent | `/models` | `/agents` |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| openab-agent | ✅ Returns available models via `configOptions` in `session/new` response | ❌ |
| kiro-cli | ✅ Returns available models via `models` fallback | ✅ Returns modes (`kiro_default`, `kiro_planner`) via `modes` fallback |
| claude-code | ❌ No `configOptions` emitted | ❌ |
| codex | ❌ | ❌ |
| gemini | ❌ | ❌ |
| cursor-agent | ❌ (tracking: #493) | ❌ |
| copilot | ❌ (tracking: #496) | ❌ |

If the agent doesn't expose options, the user sees: `⚠️ No model options available. Start a conversation first by @mentioning the bot.`

> **Backward compatibility:** `openab-agent` returns `configOptions` in the `session/new` response (alongside `sessionId`). ACP clients that only read `sessionId` will continue to work — `configOptions` is additive. Clients that support `/models` should read `configOptions[].options` to populate the model picker. Each model option includes a `provider` field (`"anthropic"` or `"openai"`) for routing.

> **Note:** Discord Select Menus are limited to 25 items. If the agent returns more, only the first 25 are shown with a count of how many were truncated.

### `/cancel`

Sends a `session/cancel` JSON-RPC notification to the ACP backend. This aborts in-flight LLM requests and tool calls immediately — no need to wait for the current response to finish.

### `/reset`

Cancels any in-flight operation, then removes the session from the pool. The ACP process terminates once the last reference is released. The next message in the thread or DM will automatically create a fresh session.

This is equivalent to the `sessions close` + `sessions new` pattern used by [OpenClaw ACPX](https://github.com/openclaw/acpx).

**What gets cleared:**
- Conversation history
- ACP process and connection
- Suspended session state (no resume after reset)

**What is preserved:**
- Bot identity and system prompt (re-applied on next session creation)
- Config settings in `config.toml`

### `/export-thread`

Fetches the current Discord thread or DM history and returns a `.txt` file as an ephemeral follow-up. The transcript includes message timestamps, author names and IDs, message text, and attachment URLs.

**Optional parameters** (mutually exclusive — use at most one):

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `limit` | Integer | Export only the most recent N messages (1–5000) |
| `since` | String | Export messages after this message ID (right-click → Copy Message ID) |
| `days` | Integer | Export messages from the last N days (1–365). Rolling N×24h window from now. |
| `all` | Boolean | Export all messages (up to 5000) |

If no parameter is provided, the **last 100 messages** are exported.

**Examples:**
```
/export-thread                              → last 100 messages (default)
/export-thread limit:500                    → most recent 500 messages
/export-thread since:1503744866100842698    → messages after this specific message
/export-thread days:3                       → messages from the last 3 days (rolling 72h)
/export-thread all:true                     → export all (cap 5000)
```

**Constraints:**
- Only works in allowed Discord threads or enabled DMs.
- Specifying more than one filter returns an error.
- Very large exports may be truncated to fit Discord's attachment size limit.

## Passing CLI Commands via @mention

In addition to slash commands, you can pass built-in CLI commands directly after an @mention:

```
@MyBot /compact
@MyBot /clear
@MyBot /model claude-sonnet-4
```

These are forwarded as-is to the ACP session as a prompt. Any command the underlying CLI supports in its interactive mode works here. This is the recommended workaround for agents that don't expose `configOptions`.

## `/remind`

Set a one-shot delayed reminder that mentions users or roles in the channel after a specified delay.

**Syntax:**
```
/remind targets:<@user @role ...> message:<text> delay:<duration>
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `targets` | Yes | Space-separated @mentions (users and/or roles) |
| `message` | Yes | Reminder text |
| `delay` | Yes | Duration before firing: `1m` to `30d` (supports `m`, `h`, `d` and combinations like `1h30m`) |

**Constraints:**
- Only humans can use `/remind` (bots are rejected)
- Minimum delay: 1 minute
- Maximum delay: 30 days
- Maximum message length: 1800 characters
- Maximum 5 active reminders per user
- Maximum 10 mention targets per reminder (use a @role for larger groups)
- `@everyone` and `@here` in messages are automatically neutralized (will not trigger mass mentions)
- One-shot only (fires once, then removed)
- Reminders persist across bot restarts (stored in `$HOME/.openab/reminders.json`)

**Examples:**
```
/remind targets:@Alice @Bob message:Review PR #42 delay:2h
/remind targets:@Reviewers message:Stand-up time delay:30m
/remind targets:@Charlie message:Check deployment delay:1d
```

**When fired, the bot posts:**
```
⏰ Reminder from @sender:
"Review PR #42"
cc @Alice @Bob
```
